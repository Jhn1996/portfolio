        <h3>I came to the US as an exchange student from Zhengzhou, China at the age of sixteen. Since then I have lived and explored many different cities in the U.S and embraced rich and diverse culture. From a small village in Burr Oak, Michigan to the Historical City Boston then to a college town in East Lansing and to the Innovative Palo Alto in California. 
          <br>I currently live in Ann Arbor and I am a Master Candidate at UMSI, University Of Michigan - School of information.
           I am expecting to finish my Master on April 2021, and I am excited to see where I land next!</h3>

        <h3>My focus on user experience design and research at School of Information @University of Michigan prepared me with the knowledge of understanding the world of information and the complex relationship between people and technology. I am especially passionate about working in the healthcare industry as a UX designer and researcher. I wanted to use design in technology to improve quality of life for people, empower them, especially those with disabilities and special needs.</h3>
